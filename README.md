# WS Products Spider

## Description
This is a simple Web Scraping Spider Class written in Python using Seleniu, Requests and BeautifulSoap Libraries.
You can use it to extract data from a website where is a list of products. Spider enter product page and extract data.
Of course you have to implement your own selectors so this class is more like a template.
